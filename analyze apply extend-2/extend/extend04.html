                <!-- Use the paragraph element below to identify the online color converter you used to complete this assignment. Include an absolute link to your resource and include the target attribute to open the page in a new tab. -->
                <p>Color Converter Used: <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_converter.asp" target="_blank">W3s Color Converter</a></p>

                <!-- Use the paragraph element below to compare and contrast your findings regarding hexadecimal, RGB, and HSL color codes. -->
                <p>A hex code is a hexadecimal way to represent a color in RGB format by combining three values:
									the amounts of red, green and blue in a particular shade of color. RGB is an additive system that uses varying
									intensities of red, green, and blue to create color on a digital screen.
									Essentially, RGB colors begin as a true shade of black. HSL stands for hue, saturation, and lightness. Itâ€™s based on the RGB color wheel.
									Each color has an angle and a percentage value for the saturation and lightness values.</p>

                <!-- Use the paragraph element below to identify your preferred color code format (hexadecimal, RBG, or HSL) and why. -->
                <p>Preferred color code format: hex</p>

                <!-- Use the paragraph element to discuss HWB color. -->
                <p>HWB summary: HWB stands for hue, whiteness and blackness. Like HSL, the hue can be anywhere within a range of 0 to 360.
									The other two arguments control how much white or black is mixed into that hue, up to 100% (which would result in a totally white or totally
									black color). If equal amounts of white and black are mixed in, the color becomes increasingly gray. We can think of this as being similar to
									mixing paint. It could be especially useful for creating monochrome color palettes.</p>

                <!-- Use the paragraph element to discuss CMYK color. -->
                <p>CMYK summary: CMYK is a four-color process and stands for cyan, magenta, yellow and key (black),
									and is preferred for use on printed materials because it helps achieve a true color.</p>
